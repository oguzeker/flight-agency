== Summary

This is a demo project implemented for `*Finartz*` interview rounds of *2020*. This is a just simple airline ticket sales application implemented only for demonstation purposes.

== Motivation

This application is implemented to manage flight operations and to arrage ticket purchases.

== Code style

This project uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller[`Model-View-Controller`] pattern for the directory structure and resposibility distribution among layers of abstraction.

We deliberately chose not to employ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-control-boundary[`Entity-Control-Boundary`] pattern for practicality.
